# P2PLending.LoanMonitor

## What is it?

LoanMonitor is a simple UWP application to monitor peer-to-peer lending platforms for new issued loans. If new loans are detected, the application shows toast notification with number of loans for every credit rating

Right now, only Paskolu Klubas loan issuer is supported.

## Getting started

## Further development

There are plans to add other loan issuers to the app as well as add new loan data presentation in the app. Moreover, the button 'View in browser' in notification does not do anything as of now:)
